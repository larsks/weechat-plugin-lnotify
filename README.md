This is a fork of the [lnotify][] plugin for weechat. It works correctly under both Python 2 and Python 3, and avoids compatability issues with the `ps` command found in the upstream version. It includes some validation tests to ensure things are functioning correctly.

[lnotify]: https://github.com/weechat/scripts/blob/master/python/lnotify.py

To run the tests, use the `pytest` command.
